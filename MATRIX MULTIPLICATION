#An algorithm to solve the matrix multiplication

STEP1 :   	START the program. 
STEP 2:     give input of matrices A and B.
STEP 3:     assign C be a new matrix with its own size.
STEP 4:     calculate for i from 1 to m; 
   4.2:     for j from 1 to n and for k from 1 to p
STEP 5:     assign sum = 0. 
STEP 6:     Set sum ← sum + Aik × B. kj Set Cij ← sum.
STEP 6.1:   return c
STEP 7:     STOP the program
